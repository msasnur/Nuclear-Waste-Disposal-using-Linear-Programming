# Nuclear-Waste-Disposal-using-Linear-Programming

Proposed a mathematical formulation to reduce the impact of nuclear waste when transporting them from the Power Plant to a disposal site. Used R programming, network model, and integer programming to solve the mathematical formula and reduce the exposure of nuclear waste while transporting to a small percentage of population.
